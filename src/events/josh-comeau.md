CSS can sometimes feel like a very inconsistent language. Why is this snippet I've used countless times suddenly behaving differently?!

It turns out, there's a lot going on under the hood. CSS is a collection of complex layout algorithms, with all sorts of hidden mechanisms and implicit behaviours. When we take the time to learn how CSS works, the language starts to make a lot more sense, and the unpleasant surprises become much less common.

In this talk, we'll dig into common misunderstandings about CSS, and see if we can fill in some gaps in our mental model of the language.
