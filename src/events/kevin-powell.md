Creating layouts with CSS can be tricky, and it's complicated by the fact that we have two different layout tools in Flexbox and Grid.
Deciding which one to use in any given situation isn't always obvious, but it can be made a lot easier when we lean into the strengths of each one.
In this talk, we'll break down what the strengths of both Flexbox and Grid are, helping you simplify the decision-making process and getting you working with the best tools for the job.
