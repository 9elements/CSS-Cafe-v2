description: "CSS shape blobbing is a really cool effect that I started toying with way before I understood how it works in the back. This lack of understanding meant I was unaware of the technique's limitations, unaware of where it was the case to bring in other tricks to achieve the results I wanted instead of keeping on modifying the example code and only getting frustrated in the process.

To spare you the same frustration, this talk is going to show you what I have since learned, how that helps with achieving those really cool blobbing effects I didn't know how to get to for years and how the same technique can be used to easily achieve something else I previously didn't think was really doable using only CSS: halftone patterns!

So join me for a trip into the world of CSS graphical effects. There will be clever tricks, live coding and cute animals!"
