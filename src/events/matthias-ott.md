We have a problem: modern web technology is getting ever more complex. As a result, teams are struggling to produce their best work and we are often failing the people we are building for. One reason for that: the infamous and ever-growing gaps between design and development. How can we overcome those divisions and deepen our common understanding of the material we are building with? And why is CSS one key component of all that? In this talk, we will look at possible solutions and practical examples that will enable us to forge links between the disciplines and to design and engineer better with the inherent flexibility of the Web â€“ together.
