Styling and extending native HTML controls or components (like select, input[type='file'] etc.) has long been a problem of the web platform.

We'll start our meetup with a 30-minutes-presentation which explores the problem, shows possible solutions and defines a process for a holistic approach to addressing the problem: the Open UI project.

Afterwards, we'll have another 30 minutes, during which we'd love to hear about your pain points with styling controls and what your opinion on the different ideas of the Open UI project are.
