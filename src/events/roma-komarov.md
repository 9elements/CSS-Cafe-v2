  Roma is a front-end web developer at Datadog and based in Paris. He loves CSS, and most of the things he does, writes, or thinks about are CSS-related. On his site he collects his experiments and articles about it. Sometimes he finds himself improving the ways he writes CSS: He's the author of Hayaku, bemto-components, bemto for Pug.js, and used to maintain Stylus.

What happens when different CSS properties collide? There are multiple ways to find out! But the best way is to experiment and see what happens.

In this talk, Roma will walk you through some of his published and some not yet seen experiments with CSS, and describe the thought process behind them.
