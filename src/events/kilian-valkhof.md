description: "Responsive design turned 10 years old last year. Since then browser capabilities have changed a lot, and they're set to change even more. We'll explore new and upcoming media queries that will let website authors make websites that respond not just to screen sizes, but to many different user preferences and situations. Learn how to implement these in forward compatible ways with practical tips and examples."

speakerBio: 'Kilian Valkhof is the creator of Polypane, the browser for building websites. He wrote his first article on mobile web design all the way back in 2008 (with an exciting look ahead at "media features"!) and has not stopped thinking about responsive websites since. Kilian is a solo developer building his and hopefully your dream browser, he writes about the web on kilianvalkhof.com and anywhere else he is allowed to, and is an active open source contributor.'
