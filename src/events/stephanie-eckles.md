Recently, Stephanie released http://smolcss.dev which demos minimal modern CSS snippets for use in layouts and components. The 'smol' theme is reflected in the length of summaries and lines of code. But, there's a lot going on that enables that minimalism! Let's deep dive into some of the examples (and more!) to learn about some modern CSS properties you may have missed or aren't using to their full extent. Stephanie will expand upon decision points in selecting these properties to help you use them in your solutions, including anticipating and addressing accessibility concerns.
