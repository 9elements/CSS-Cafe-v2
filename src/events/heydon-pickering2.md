People talk a lot about how CSS “isn’t scoped” and that this is a problem somehow. But what do they mean? Isn’t apportioning scope to style what CSS is for? This session will ask whether “global” CSS is such a bad thing, if stylesheets themselves are really a good thing, if we really need to rely on a framework developed at a genocide fomenting social media company to add scope to CSS, and what we can learn about CSS from the critical reception of Swedish death metal band Entombed’s 1996 album, “To Ride, Shoot Straight, and Speak The Truth”.
