CSSBattle is a code-golfing game: replicate the given patterns with just HTML and CSS, the shortest code wins.

Gunnar will reveal some magic tricks to do so. (Keep your expectations low: heâ€™s not gonna take you into the top ten. ðŸ˜œ) Some of which you would never use in production code, while others might prove useful.

Warning: this game is addictive!
