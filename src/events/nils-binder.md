description: "As an icebreaker, Nils wants to tell you something about CSS-backgrounds: If you learn CSS today, there are a lot of properties that are quite new and exciting. Talking about CSS-grid, blend-mode, custom-properties ... etc. But already for many years, there is the property called background. And I think it's pretty underrated. So I would like to show you what the not-so-familiar possibilities are that this seemingly simple property has to offer."

Also, he is an origami enthusiast spending hours folding paper.'
