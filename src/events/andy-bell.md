CSS is a handy language that’s often misunderstood, even with the powerful new layout tools that we have at our disposal. This misunderstanding can lead to some wildly over-engineered solutions where the main byproduct is high-interest technical debt, frustration and worst of all, great expense for users.

In this session, I’m going to share with you the tricks that I use to produce highly flexible CSS for design systems, pattern libraries, rich applications and good ol’ websites. We focus on letting the browser make decisions for us, rather than micromanaging them by using algorithms, axioms, the cascade and a solid component strategy.

By the end of the session, I hope that you will see the value in distilling layout problems to their simplest solutions that utilise the power modern CSS and the browser’s capabilities.
