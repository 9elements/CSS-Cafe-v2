speakerBio: |-
  Bramus Van Damme is a web developer from Belgium. From the moment he discovered view-source at the age of 14 (way back in 1997), he fell in love with the web and has been tinkering with it ever since.

  With his company 3RDS he works as a freelance developer, tackling both the frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) and the backend (PHP, MySQL). His current focus is on JavaScript, React and React Native yet his love for CSS will never fade.

With View Transitions, you can create immersive native-like experiences that have smooth and seamless transitions between pages in your SPA. With Scroll-Transitions you can drive animations by the act of scrolling. What if you combined both? How does it work? And what about MPA? Could that ever work?
