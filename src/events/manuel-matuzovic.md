description: "What’s the first thing that comes to your mind when you think of “CSS and accessibility”? Maybe text size, color contrast, or DOM order. Important topics, without question, but there’s a lot more to consider when writing inclusive CSS. This talk aims to help you create better interfaces by adapting to your users’ needs. You’ll learn how to debug and test with CSS, how attribute selectors can improve accessibility, and when CSS affects the semantics of your HTML."
